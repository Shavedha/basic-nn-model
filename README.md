# EXPERIMENT - 01 Developing a Neural Network Regression Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network regression model for the given dataset.

## THEORY

* Neural network regression models are a type of machine learning algorithm designed for predicting continuous numerical values. Comprising interconnected nodes organized in layers, neural networks can capture complex relationships within data. The input layer receives features, while hidden layers process information through weighted connections, and the output layer produces the regression prediction.
*  Training involves adjusting weights based on the model's error compared to actual values, optimizing performance.
*  Neural network regression models excel in handling nonlinear patterns and are widely used in various fields, such as finance, economics, and engineering, due to their ability to learn intricate relationships in data for accurate numeric predictions.

## NEURAL NETWORK MODEL
The neural network architecture comprises two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, each having 5 and 3 neurons respectively, and a linear output layer with 1 neuron.





## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:

Loading the dataset

### STEP 2:

Split the dataset into training and testing

### STEP 3:

Create MinMaxScalar objects ,fit the model and transform the data.

### STEP 4:

Build the Neural Network Model and compile the model.

### STEP 5:

Train the model with the training data.

### STEP 6:

Plot the performance plot

### STEP 7:

Evaluate the model with the testing data.
